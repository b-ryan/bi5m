# Welcome to Bi5m

## Introduction

This project provides a secure way to configure and use Bitcoin Core to create
and use a multisig wallet.

A multisig wallet is a secure way to store your Bitcoin where multiple
computers must each approve any transaction. This lessens the risk of loss or
theft by not relying on a single computer to hold the keys to all your funds.

In a multisig setup, you generate N number of keys and require that M of them
be used to authorize transactions. This is called an "M of N" multisig. For
example, in a 2 of 3 multisig, you may use any 2 of the 3 total keys to
authorize transactions.

Bitcoin Core is the safest software available for using Bitcoin. Bi5m adds only
the minimal amount necessary to securely use multisig wallets.

## How it Works

The instructions within this documentation will serve to get you started. You
will first gather equipment, the most important of which are the computers that
run the Bitcoin Core software and the Bi5m software. After gathering these
computers and some other supplies, you will:

* Install Linux on each computer.
* Install Bi5m, which will itself download Bitcoin Core for you.
* Use Bi5m to walk you through setting up wallets and each computer and
  creating backups.

You'll then be able to use Bi5m and Bitcoin Core to to verify your Bitcoin
balances, confirm transactions, and spend your Bitcoin.

## Get Started

Before proceeding, first read through [Before Getting
Started](before-getting-started).
